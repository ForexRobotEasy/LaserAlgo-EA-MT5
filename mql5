//| Terms of Reference for LaserAlgo EA MT5 Code Development         |
//|                                                                 |
//| 1. Develop an AI-powered trading solution for Forex market based |
//|    on the LaserAlgo EA MT5 product description.                 |
//|                                                                 |
//| 2. Utilize artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify   |
//|    and capitalize on market patterns.                            |
//|                                                                 |
//| 3. Implement trading decisions based on identified patterns,     |
//|    focusing on a good risk to reward ratio (R:R) rather than     |
//|    grid or martingale methods.                                   |
//|                                                                 |
//| 4. Include a stop loss for every trade placed to ensure risk     |
//|    management.                                                   |
//|                                                                 |
//| 5. Develop necessary trading functions to execute the algorithm, |
//|    including but not limited to:                                |
//|    a. Pattern recognition: Identify and analyze market patterns  |
//|       using AI algorithms.                                       |
//|    b. Trade execution: Place trades based on identified patterns |
//|       and risk management principles.                            |
//|    c. Stop loss management: Set stop loss for each trade to      |
//|       limit potential losses.                                    |
//|    d. Risk management: Implement risk management principles to   |
//|       control the amount of capital allocated to each trade.     |
//|    e. Account monitoring: Continuously monitor account balance,  |
//|       open positions, and overall performance.                   |
//|    f. Position sizing: Determine appropriate position sizes      |
//|       based on risk tolerance and account balance.               |
//|    g. Trade exit strategy: Develop a strategy for exiting trades |
//|       based on predefined criteria.                              |
//|    h. Performance tracking: Record and analyze the performance   |
//|       of the AI-powered trading solution.                        |
//|                                                                 |
//| 6. Ensure the code is well-documented and follows best practices |
//|    for readability and maintainability.                          |
//|                                                                 |
//| 7. Test the code thoroughly to ensure accuracy and reliability.  |
//|                                                                 |
