## LaserAlgo EA MT5

The LaserAlgo EA MT5 is an AI-powered trading solution developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to identify and capitalize on market patterns in the Forex market. The code is designed to implement trading decisions based on the identified patterns, focusing on a good risk to reward ratio (R:R) rather than grid or martingale methods.

### Key Features:

- **Pattern Recognition**: The code includes AI algorithms to identify and analyze market patterns, providing a basis for trading decisions.

- **Trade Execution**: Trades are placed based on the identified patterns and risk management principles.

- **Stop Loss Management**: A stop loss is included for every trade placed to ensure risk management.

- **Risk Management**: The code implements risk management principles to control the amount of capital allocated to each trade.

- **Account Monitoring**: The code continuously monitors the account balance, open positions, and overall performance.

- **Position Sizing**: Appropriate position sizes are determined based on risk tolerance and account balance.

- **Trade Exit Strategy**: A strategy for exiting trades based on predefined criteria is developed.

- **Performance Tracking**: The performance of the AI-powered trading solution is recorded and analyzed.

### How it Works:

1. Initialization: The code initializes the necessary libraries and global variables. It also sets constants, such as the risk percentage per trade.

2. AI Initialization: The AI algorithms are initialized to identify and analyze market patterns.

3. Risk Management: The risk management module sets the risk percentage per trade.

4. Trade Execution: The trade execution module is initialized to place trades based on identified patterns and risk management principles.

5. Account Monitoring: The account monitoring module is initialized to continuously monitor the account balance, open positions, and overall performance.

6. OnTick Function: The OnTick function is called on each tick of the market. It performs the following tasks:
   - Calculates the position size based on risk tolerance and account balance.
   - Identifies and analyzes market patterns using AI algorithms.
   - Places trades based on identified patterns and risk management principles.
   - Sets stop loss for each trade to limit potential losses.
   - Continuously monitors account balance, open positions, and overall performance.
   - Develops a strategy for exiting trades based on predefined criteria.
   - Records and analyzes the performance of the AI-powered trading solution.
